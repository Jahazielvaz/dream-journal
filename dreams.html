        <p>
          FEEL: This was by far one of the coolest things I’ve ever experienced in a dream! It felt magical, and wonderful, and full of adventure and fun. I wish words could describe how I felt
          <br><br>
	        It began when I decided to take a random vacation road trip, and so I got to a green mountain like place, probably what you would expect in some kind of remote forest like place, but this place itself was definitely out of the ordinary: it had some very interesting ruins. It had these sort of carved mini statues that game the place a feeling of mysticism. It was a bit of a scary place but not in an every type of way but rather in a mesmerizing adventure type of way.  It had mossy natural boulders and mystic waters. It’s something you would expect out of like a magic the gathering card or something. The thing that made it kind of scary is that it was such a mystic place that you would probably expect to find some mystic wild beasts. It had a bit of a jungle/forest type of feel.
	        I kept walking in awe, and then I got to this waterpark type of place, but it was way different from anything I had ever seen! There were some people but definitely not many. Very few people knew about this place. I was hesitant to come in because I didn’t know what to expect. I remember walking in, and I believe I was given instructions. This place seemed to have a giant pool type of thing going, but the architecture was magnificent. There were stone arches on top of the pool like area, and there were these sort of paradisiacal mountains surrounding this place. I felt very excited and very joyful. Eventually I was led to enter this pool like place. As I came into this pool (I don’t remember how I entered) It turns out it wasn’t a pool at all. It was a magical underwater city like place. This place was phenomenal! It had some building like structures, and stone arches that you got to go through. There was somehow this magical stream of water that you could use at will, or in other words, you could choose to swim slow or extremely fast. You could breathe underwater, and there were these mystical fish and amphibians that you could telepathically communicate with. Despite it’s beauty, the central focus wasn’t the architecture or the boulders, inside the water, but it was the nature found inside it.  There were green patches of small little hills, and partial mountains inside the water. I swam and swam and communicated with a wide array of fish that I had never seen and that I have a hard time remembering how to describe at this time. I swam and sped up and moved around! And I felt such joy and excitement!
          <br><br>
          TAKEAWAYS: We must explore and seek for the beauty that is all ready around us. God’s creations are amazing! One day perhaps if I still remember, I can attempt to recreate this place. I live for the magic, and the beauty!

      <article>
        <p>
          FLASHBACK: Earlier in my life I was really all about the night life, and I was always hitting on women. I used to learn and teach this. I was drinking, partying etc. I have a friend named Alfredo. In real life, he never drank or hit on women or anything of the sort. I gave him a super hard time because of this.  Eventually I came back to my church, and left all the alcohol, the women ish, etc, and all the craziness. I started sort of preparing to go on a mission for my church, even-though I still had some bad habits. I was willing to do a lot for my friends and I was really trying to help them at the time.
          <br><br>
          Here is where my  dream begins (Please keep in mind my friend’s personality. Doesn’t talk to girls, didn’t really drink till later on, and is not social at all): I was inside this weird kind of run down club. It had a feel of wretchedness, and I felt like a dirty dumpy, depressing place. In this dream I had the same mindset I had in real life at the time. I was trying to serve God and to not sin and to purify my mind, so naturally I felt very uncomfortable. But I was in this club with Alfredo. There were not many people in the club but there were a few girls here and there, and needless to say, they were wearing pretty revealing clothes, which would have been a turn-on for me back in the day, but this time, I really was in no mood to talk to them, let alone pick them up. I felt confident in my ability to do so, but I had zero desire to do so. I really wanted to go which was a 180 degree shift from before. Alfredo on the other hand was really eager to talk to them (Which is totally the opposite of him character)
  	      I could see in these women’s faces the frivolity, the shallowness, the emptiness. They were physically fairly beautiful but internally they were empty shells. Alfredo was truly making an effort to talk to them and they were just ignoring him, so I got mad at the situation and at the fact that they were treating him like that. It felt like Satan was taunting me, as if he was telling me to approach them to see if I could pick them up (But inside of me I knew I definitely could if I wanted to, but it was just a trap.)
          <br><br>
  	      I walked up to Alfredo and in front of them I told him, lets go man, these girls are not even that pretty. We’ll find others that are way cooler to talk to (I did this in the hopes of convincing him to leave this place) He would nod his head and say “Yea, wait just a bit, I just need to talk to them really quick.” And he would keep trying to talk to them even-though they were completely ignoring him. I tried to convince him multiple times but with no success.
  	      Eventually these women started heading towards the door and he started following them, and I told him “Alfredo wait! Leave them alone, they’re not worth it. Well find way cooler ones”  He would acknowledge me, but would make an excuse and then continue trying to talk to them.
          These women eventually headed out the door, and he started following them, and I started chasing after him. I would talk to him (I was beyond annoyed at this point, but I felt like I couldn’t leave him alone.) and he would keep trying to reason with me but he would keep following them. They started walking faster and faster, and he started following faster and faster. It was very late, probably around 12:00 am. We walked for what seemed to be hours. Eventually these women started walking into this river of water. This river had like a concrete sidewalk on each of it’s sides, so Alfredo started walking into it, and of course I followed. The water was dirty, and stinky. As these women got deeper and deeper into the water, we began to lose them (Which I was happy about) but Alfredo kept walking faster and faster, until we eventually lost sight of them, but Alfredo wouldn’t give up. The water got filthier and filthier. The water was kind of dark, but as we got deeper in, it started to get lighter but definitely filthier: we started finding dirty diapers, and some dead squirrels. To make matters worse, the sidewalks on the side of the river began to get smaller and smaller, until there was very little room to walk. We eventually ran out of sidewalk space and I had to go into the filthy water in order to continue chasing Alfredo.
  	      As I walked into the dirty waters, it got harder and harder to walk because the water was getting thicker and thicker with filth, and it’s stench was almost unbearable. We started finding more and more dead animals: More dead squirrels, dead frogs, beheaded animals, and even dead turtles. The water got so disgustingly thick and white, that it became like a jelly. At this point I lost Alfredo, and at this point it was getting light outside. (It was probably around 4:30am) I realized that I was stuck in this filthy place, and with no way back home and completely and utterly lost. It was a feeling of disgust, despair, and hopelessness. I walked out of this river thing, and it was still mainly dark even though it was kinda light. I began to seek for directions but there weren’t many people on the street, and the ones that were there, had no idea how to help me.
          <br><br>
          WARNING: I believe this was one of those inspired dreams that actually are trying to tell you something, call me crazy but I can really feel the difference between regular dreams, and dreams that are trying to tell you something, or that have a deeper meaning. At this time as I said I was getting ready to go on a mission. And I was pretty much following all the commandments, and I was staying righteous for the most part, but I had this major weakness disguised as a strength: I cared so much about my friends that many times I didn’t see that being around them would hurt me, just like in this dream.
  	      I had a friend named tony who used to smoke like a chimney. He was awesome to hang out with, but he wasn’t the healthiest person to be around, specially not since I was getting ready to go on a mission.
          I felt that this dream was trying to tell me something: I wasn’t quite sure what it was but I had an idea. I knew that I had this weakness. Later on I started becoming weaker and weaker spiritually. I needed to leave my friends in order to stay protected since I wasn’t strong enough on my own yet. Aided by this dream, I knew that I had to leave all my friends behind at least temporarily, and so I did. Later on I realized that if I hadn’t left them, I probably wouldn’t have been able to go on a mission!

      <article>
        <p>
          So this dream is definitely cliché, and something you would totally find in a somewhat predictable cartoon, or series, however, being able to experience it in real life (Or at least my brain thought so.) is something out of this world. This is one of the dreams that when you wake up, you keep trying to go back to sleep, just so that you can have it again.

        	This dream started with me walking into an extremely fine clothing store. This store was seriously no joke! They had some extremely cool looking jackets, and probably shirts (I don’t remember what other stuff there was, but I clearly remember the jackets.), etc. All of them custom made, leather and some of the finest materials that exist. Each article of clothing was between $2,000 and $30,000. I certainly didn’t have that kind of money in my dream, or in real life as a matter fact. I definitely didn’t feel like I belonged there. I felt out of place, but a part of me wanted to feel what it was like to be powerful, and I wanted to pretend for just a second, that I was a powerful man. I was looking at this particular jacket that looked like something taken out of the matrix, but even cooler than that. I didn’t want to get too close because I didn’t want and sales person to try to approach me. I didn’t want to run the risk of being found out that I had no money.
          Sure enough, as I hesitantly looked from afar, I heard a voice from behind me “Try it on” I turned to look, to find that there was your typical Asian sales clerk lady. She was wearing a pencil skirt, and somewhat short hair. She was probably in her 40’s, and she looked really powerful.
          Upon seeing her, I immediately began to feel uncomfortable. I knew she was going to try and sell me the jacket.
          I replied “No, it’s ok. It’s not really my type” (trying to protect my ego)
          <br><br>
          She insisted, and she said “It’s ok, you can try it on” (As if saying. I understand if you’re broke, I won’t judge you. Or perhaps she still believed I did indeed have money.)
        	As I’m standing here, dealing with this lady, This beautiful, super cool looking girl walks in (She had an outfit that resembled something you would see in a black widow action movie but, a little more medieval. Like maybe a modern ninja outfit) She had your typical long black hair, and the attitude to go along with it. She was short and to the point in her speech, and she was probably about my height. You can tell this girl was powerful and didn’t take crap from anybody. This girl walked in with the urgency of a Newyorker, and laser focused on me.
        	When the cool ninja girl walked in, the Asian lady grabbed the jacket and put it in a bag, and said “take it” I replied “No it’s ok” (Feeling kinda dumb and embarrassed because now I was in front of this super cool girl)
        	The girl walked up to me and said “Hurry up and grab the jacket, and stop wasting time, let’s go!”
          As you can imagine, I was very puzzled, and perplexed by the situation. I had no idea what was going on but it had an air of excitement.
          The clerk lady put the jacket in the bag, and handed it to me, and once again, I refused to take it. The clerk lady at this point, notified me that the jacket had all ready been paid for, by the girl!
        	The girl at this point with even more impatience said “Let’s go we have no time!” and grabbed my hand and dragged me out of the store. I was wandering if the girl had mistaken me to be someone else, but I was too curious, and scared to ask many questions. I did probably ask some questions, but I she didn’t respond anything.
        	We walked through some underground tunnel things that looked super cool. After a while of practically running (And my feeling the excitement building) we finally got to this small little room. As the girl walked in, this guy asked “Did you get him?” to which she didn’t respond much. I arrived only to find a small group of about 5 or 6 guys. Again the guys looked super cool. They were dressed in some kind of warrior clothes, kind of same feel at the girl’s like modern ninja warriors. Like combining the ninja attire and something taken out of the matrix.
          <br><br>
        	As I arrived there, I noticed that they were super united, and that they were some kind of rebel group fighting for some cause.  I noticed that even the girl respected the leader of this syndicate a LOT. He was like their big brother. All these guys were around their mid twenties. I believe the leader had some kind on eye patch.
        	I asked “Why am I here” to which the leader replied “We’ll find out” All of these guys seemed to be very short with their words, and weren’t very mushy, or sentimental, but they truly loved and cared for each other, but most important of all, they trusted each other.
        	The leader all of the sudden gave the order “There’s no time, Let’s go” The leader was the one dragging me out this time and, we all took off. I had no idea why I was there but I knew there was an important reason. I also knew at this point that the leader didn’t know either. We came out to the city where there were massive trails of train tracks.
          The place looked like something you would find in medieval japan. It was comprised of little houses with clay and metal roof tops. It was very nostalgic to look at. While the place had a medieval feel, it also had a touch of technology and advancement. It was like a combination between the present or even the future and the past.
          Suddenly they started to jump on the tracks, and gliding on them with their feet. I had to run lightning fast! I don’t know how I was able to keep up. I was so excited to see them glide and I felt a sense of comradely, and I was happy to be able to be among such an amazing team. While they weren’t very complementing or anything of the sort, I could tell that I was very important to them, but even they themselves didn’t know why.
        	We gathered outside some of these little houses which were all next to each other. As they were talking, all of the sudden, a team of police guys surrounded us. While is stood there stupefied, every member of the syndicate began to fight fiercely. While we were easily outnumbered ten to one, these cop guys were no math for the syndicate members.  These police guys tried to take me down multiple times, but the syndicate protected me as a prized jewel (and in particular, the girl. I think she was assigned as my bodyguard)
          Each team member had their unique set of moves, and weapons, They were lightning fast, and could dodge, counter attack, kick etc. The team jumped on top of the roofs, and I did my best to climb it. We started fighting on the roof tops! I hated being the weak link, so I did my best to fight with my slow and common moves. I felt even worse that they had to defend me. While I instantly felt a love and loyalty for the team, I still didn’t feel a part of the team. I still felt like the outsider.
          <br><br>
        	After the team finished taking these guys out, we ran to a small little secret room where the team gathered and the leader pulled out some battle plans. In this meeting, I discovered that the government was corrupt, communistic, murderous, shady, and over all evil! I learned that they had control of everything and everyone. I learned that the only thing standing in the government’s way was this syndicate, as well as other secret factions similar to ours. Teams, of extremely intelligent, and heroic individuals. Our team had underground connections, although I never got to meet them. In this room, they discussed how to put an end to the government and it’s corruption. The leader suddenly exclaimed once again “It’s time to move out, they’re coming!” He then gave instructions to each member of the team, and he had them split, and gave them specific missions, and then selected a rendezvous point. We split into small little teams, of 2 and 3. Fighting these cops, Meeting in secret places, sabotage missions, and specific targets became everyday life. Little by little, I began to fall more and more in love with the team. I saw them as my family. I was willing to die for them. As time went on, I got stronger, and faster. I was becoming one of the team.  Although the girl still had to defend me at times, I was becoming a fierce fighter. Unfortunately, as we got stronger, and our sabotage missions caused more damage, the government kept closing in on us more and more, to the point where it was getting really hard to meet up and plan. The government started sending more and more cops, and soldiers to take us down. And the government fighters kept growing in number and skill. All of a sudden, it wasn’t so easy to take them out. They were fierce warriors! We began to get more and more tired. Defending me got tougher and tougher, but equally I got stronger and stronger. I was beginning to realize that the end was probably very near. I was willing to throw it all away, and die fighting for the syndicate. While I always loved and admired my protector (The girl) I loved and admired my leader even more. The last thing I wanted was to disappoint him.
        	Part of the biggest sabotage plan, was to find the government factories where they created these very powerful, huge robots with which they could destroy anyone that opposed it. The persecution did not cease one second. It got more and more intense, until we had no place where we could find peace, or rest. We were exhausted from the constant fighting. We were getting more and more wounded. I felt terrible for my team, but I was willing to bleed to death fighting. Deep down I knew that my purpose would soon be discovered. We arrived outside some of the little houses (We had just gotten out of a massive fight. And we had taken everyone out) We figured we had a little time to rest, and to plan, but within 5 minutes, we had the largest team of Government soldiers surrounding us. I we could tell they were among the most elite team of fighters. We started taking serious attacks! It was a brutal fight! We were just about ready to collapse, however there was something very special about this fight. This was the first time that I had to fight completely for myself, and not only had I taken out a substantial number of soldiers, but I had actually saved the girl a few times in battle. I later realized that I HAD BECOME ONE OF THEM! We took out every last one of the soldiers, but we were beyond excited and wounded, not even 5 minutes had passed before an even bigger wave arrived. At this point we knew that unless we ran, we wouldn’t make it! It all happened so quick that we had no time to coordinate. We all split off and ran in different directions. There was no rendezvous point. This could very well be the last time we would ever see each other. Of course I ended up getting stuck with the girl (Up until not long ago, I felt inferior to her and the rest of the team, but this time, I was beginning to feel like I was a full part of the team, even though I never learned my purpose in it.)
        	We ran through skinny dark alleys between the little houses.
          <br>
          The girl had multiple weapons but among those weapons, she had some kind of metal string that she used to not only tangle enemies but also to hang off of alley tops. We got cornered by multiple of the government armies halfway through one of the alleys. The girl went ninja on them and used mainly her legs to beat them up, with lightning speed. Despite the fact that she kept taking all those guys out, I knew she was exhausted, and about ready to collapse. I got really good with my mere fists, and I began to take many of these guys out. I was also very exhausted but my love for the syndicate, and for this girl was making me fight like a lion. At some point however I was going to get daggered or something, and the girl used her metal string to grab the guy and prevent him from hurting me.  Once again, she risked her life to save mine. We took out the guys at the alley and reached a fork in the road. I could tell that this time the girl was puzzled. I responded, “Let’s go on the roof tops, and cover each other’s flanks, this way!” I grabbed her hand, and started heading north. We jumped on top of the roofs, and the government armies swarmed us once again: this time the girl’s fighting really began to decline, and she started getting sloppy (This was the first time, I had ever seen this from her.) The enemy started to take control of her, and somehow I was infused with strength even though my body was about ready to collapse. I took out the guys surrounding her, and protected her with my life.  We finished taking out the guys, and I planned a route to rendezvous with the rest of the syndicate. It is at this point that the girl’s attitude started to change towards me: while we were on our own, I had taken the role of the leader. I was the Alpha! I felt an overwhelming sense of duty, but at the same time, I felt very happy that I had grown to not only be a member of the syndicate, but now I was all she had. I had become her protector!
          <br><br>
        	 We ran through alleys, as stealth fully as we possibly could, and came out to the main street right outside the little houses, and there, to our Surprise, and relief, we found our LEADER!!!! I was so excited to see him, but extremely sad that the rest of the team wasn’t with him. We had no way to find them.
        	I hugged my leader, and gave him a brief status report. Then I started asking him questions about the rest of the team. As he started explaining the situation, I began to notice these little micro expressions, and incongruences in his voice, body language, and facial expressions. Having an extremely keen ability to read people and situations was my hidden power. This was my contribution to the team. As I noticed the incongruences, I began to realize that our beloved leader was hiding something! We had all trusted him blindly, and were ready to give up our lives for his sake. He was such a powerful, and sincere guy that we would never in a million years expect him to be hiding something from us.  Panic started to set in (Panic that he would betray us. I was in such denial), and I knew that the rest of the syndicate would never be able to pickup on such minutely small micro expressions. I would have never even dared to ever challenge my leader, but my love for the syndicate was such that I was willing to fight even my own leader, in order to protect him. I proceeded to viciously interrogate him, until; I realized that he had been lying to us all along. The heartache, disappointment and pain was massive! /the girl’s face was hard and stern. She would typically play it tough, and didn’t like to be very emotional, but even she herself kind of broke, and for a second she looked like a lost little girl who is looking to her parents to guide her. She looked at me, to see what I would do. I yelled at him, and said something along the lines of “You lied to us all along?” “You’re with the government! You’re the one that’s been ratting us out. That’s how they keep finding us wherever we go! How could you do this to your team, who trusted you with their very lives! And now (I don’t remember the names of the other 2 or 3 team members that were missing, but for the sake of a name I’ll say Vincent, and Julian) Vincent and Julian are missing because of you! They could be dead for all we know”
          My leader responded with “I did this for our team, but I don’t expect you to understand. I’m sorry, take care of (the girl’s name)” as he said that, a massive team of soldiers showed up, and our leader ran away.
        	Things were worse than ever, and to say that the treason was disheartening is an understatement. But it is at this point that I understood what my purpose was. I wasn’t here to be a part of the syndicate, but to be the leader that would replace our leader. At this point. Our weapons were pretty much destroyed, and we had no energy left to fight. We knew that if we stayed to fight, it would be a suicide. I led the girl through passageways and alleyways, and we fought as we ran. I somehow found out where the main robot building factory was, the one that the government was using to control people. We had no resources, people, or strength left, but my plan was still to head there, in order to hide enough to be able to recover, and then to destroy it somehow. At this point is when I think the girl started falling in love with me, because now I was her leader. I had become the Alpha. We still fought our way through many armies in the alleyways, and I still protected her from the enemy.
          <br><br>
        	We saw the building! And I thought to myself “For good or for bad, it’s over. If this succeeds, we will end the government and save our people. If we don’t, we’re going to die, because we have no strength left to fight” With out last ounce of strength we broke in, It was massive, and white inside. All the lights were off, so I got really happy because I realized that there was no one here guarding it. This was the perfect hiding spot, and it was our last chance for survival. We saw the silhouettes of massive machines and robots. We zoomed past multiple lab rooms (This place resembled a bit of a labyrinth) We were desperate to get to the core of this place to take it out, and after a while longer of running, We got to the main plant! (A MASSIVE and spacious open room with massive robots) We finally slowed down to catch our breath, and looked around for a second, trying to figure out how to destroy it, when suddenly, all the lights came on, and I realized that this was all a setup to take us out. I knew our lives were over, but I was nostalgic, and not willing to trade that experience for the world! When the lights came on, we looked at each other, and I woke up.
